MAGIC INFRACTION PROCEDURE GUIDE
<p>
Effective September 30, 2016
</p><p>
INTRODUCTION
</p><p>
The Magic- Infraction Procedure Guide provides judges the appropriate penalties and procedures to handle rules violations that occur during a tournament held at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level (REL), as well as the underlying philosophy that guides their implementation. It exists to protect players from potential misconduct and to protect the integrity of the tournament itself.
</p><p>
Rules violations usually require a penalty or they are unenforceable. Tournaments run at Regular REL
</p><p>
use the Judging at Regular REL document.
</p><p>
FRAMEWORK OF THIS DOCUMENT
</p><p>
This document is divided into two major parts: General Definitions and Philosophy (section 1), and Infractions (sections 2-4). Infractions are broken down into general classes (Game Play Errors, Tournament Errors, and Unsporting Conduct), and further into subclasses for specific infractions.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
See the Magic Tournament Rules for further definitions of terms in this document.

<a name="1"></a></p><h4>1  GENERAL PHILOSOPHY</h4>
Judges are neutral arbiters and enforcers of policy and rules. A judge shouldn't intervene in a game unless he or she believes a rules violation has occurred, a player with a concern or question requests assistance, or the judge wishes to prevent a situation from escalating. Judges don't stop play errors from occurring, but instead deal with errors that have occurred, penalize those who violate rules or policy, and promote fair play and sporting conduct by example and diplomacy.
<p>
Judges may intervene to prevent or preempt errors occurring outside of a game. Knowledge of a player's history or skill does not alter an infraction, but it may be taken into account during an investigation.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The purpose of a penalty is to educate the player not to make similar mistakes in the future. This is done through both an explanation of where the rules or policies were violated and a penalty to reinforce the education. Penalties are also for the deterrence and education of every other player in the event and are also used to track player behavior over time.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If a minor violation is quickly handled by the players to their mutual satisfaction, a judge does not need to intervene. If the players are playing in a way that is clear to both players, but might cause confusion to an external observer, judges are encouraged to request that the players make the situation clear, but not assess an infraction or issue any penalty. In both these situations, the judge should ensure that the game progresses normally. More significant violations are addressed by first identifying what infraction applies, then proceeding with the corresponding instructions.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Only the Head Judge is authorized to issue penalties that deviate from these guidelines. The Head Judge may not deviate from this guide's procedures except in significant and exceptional circumstances or a situation that has no applicable philosophy for guidance. Significant and exceptional circumstances are rare-a table collapses, a booster contains cards from a different set, etc. The Rules Enforcement Level, round of the tournament, age or experience-level of the player, desire to educate the player, and certification level of the judge are NOT exceptional circumstances. If another judge feels deviation is appropriate, he or she must consult with the Head Judge.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Judges are human and make mistakes. When a judge makes a mistake, he or she should acknowledge the mistake, apologize to the players, and fix it if it is not too late. If a member of the tournament staff gives a player erroneous information that causes them to commit a violation, the Head Judge is authorized to downgrade the penalty. For example, a player asks a judge whether a card is legal for a format and is told yes. When that player's deck is found to be illegal because of these cards, the Head Judge applies the normal procedure for fixing the decklist, but may downgrade the penalty to a Warning because of the direct error of the judge.
</p><p>
<a name="1.1"></a></p><h4>1.1 DEFINITION OF PENALTIES</h4>
<p>
Warning
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
A Warning is an officially tracked penalty. Warnings are used in situations of incorrect play when a small amount of time is needed to implement the corrective procedure. The purpose of a Warning is to alert judges and players involved that a problem has occurred and to keep a permanent record of the infraction in the DCI Penalty Database. A time extension should be issued if the ruling has taken more than a minute.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Game Loss
</p><p>
A Game Loss is issued in situations where the procedure to correct the offense takes a significant amount of time that may slow the entire tournament or causes significant disruption to the tournament, or in which it is impossible to continue the game due to physical disruption. It is also used for some infractions that have a higher probability for a player to gain advantage.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
A Game Loss ends the current game immediately and the player who committed the infraction is considered to have lost the game for the purpose of match reporting. The player receiving a Game Loss chooses whether to play or draw in the next game of that match, if applicable. If a Game Loss is issued before the match begins, neither player in that match may use sideboards (if the tournament uses them) for the first game they play.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Game Losses are applied to the game in which the offense occurred unless the players have begun a new game or the tournament is between rounds, in which case the loss is applied to the player's next game. If simultaneous Game Loss penalties are issued to each player, they are recorded, but do not affect the match score. If a player receives a Game Loss at the same time his or her opponent receives a Match Loss, the Game Loss is carried over into the next round.
</p><p>
Players will still receive a Game Loss if they drop from the tournament; if the penalty is issued between rounds, they will still receive it even though they will not be paired for the next round.
</p><p>
Match Loss
</p><p>
A Match Loss is a severe penalty that is usually issued when the match cannot be completed due to timing restrictions or because the match itself has been compromised.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Match Losses are applied to the match during which the offense occurred unless the match has already ended, in which case the penalty will be applied to the player's next match. Players will still be issued a Match Loss penalty if they drop from the tournament, though they won't be paired for the next round.
</p><p>
Disqualification
</p><p>
A Disqualification is issued for activity that damages the integrity of a tournament as a whole or for severe unsporting conduct.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The recipient of a Disqualification does not need to be a player in the tournament. He or she may be a spectator or other bystander. If this happens, he or she must be entered into the tournament in Wizards Event Reporter (WER) so that he or she may be disqualified and reported to the DCI.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Disqualification can occur without proof of action so long as the Head Judge determines sufficient information exists to believe the tournament's integrity may have been compromised.
</p><p>
It is recommended that the Head Judge's report reflect this fact.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
When this penalty is applied, the player loses his or her current match and is dropped from the tournament. If a player has already received prizes at the time he or she is disqualified, that player may keep those prizes but does not receive any additional prizes or awards he or she may be due.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
When a player is disqualified during a tournament, he or she is removed from the tournament and does not take up a place in the standings. This means that all players in the tournament will advance one spot in the standings and are entitled to any prizes the new standing would offer. If the Disqualification takes place after a cut is made, no additional players advance in place of the disqualified player although they do move up a spot in the standings. For example, if a player is disqualified during the quarterfinal round of a Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier, the former 9th place finisher does not advance into the single elimination top 8, but he or she does move into 8th place in the standings.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="1.2"></a></p><h4>1.2 APPLYING PENALTIES</h4>
<p>
Penalties are included with the tournament report so that a permanent record can be kept in the DCI Penalty Database. Additionally, any penalty of Game Loss or higher should be reported to the Head Judge, and it is recommended that only the Head Judge issue penalties of this nature (with the exception of Tardiness (3.1) and Deck Errors (3.5)).
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Being enrolled in the tournament is not a requirement to receive a penalty. Although these guidelines refer to players, other people in the venue, such as spectators, staff, or judges may be enrolled into (and dropped from) the tournament in order to receive a penalty.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Any time a penalty is issued, the judge must explain the infraction, the procedure for fixing the situation, and the penalty to all players involved. If the Head Judge chooses to deviate from the Infraction Procedure Guide, the Head Judge is expected to explain the standard penalty and the reason for deviation.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Some infractions include remedies to handle the offense beyond the base penalty. These procedures exist to protect officials from accusations of unfairness, bias, or favoritism. If a judge makes a ruling that is consistent with quoted text, then the complaints of a player shift from accusation of unfairness by the judge to accusations of unfair policy. Deviations from these procedures may raise accusations against the judge from the player(s) involved, or from those who hear about it. These procedures do not, and should not, take into account the game being played, the current situation that the game is in, or who will benefit strategically from the procedure associated with a penalty. While it is tempting to try to fix game situations, the danger of missing a subtle detail or showing favoritism to a player (even unintentionally) makes it a bad idea.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Infractions with the same root cause, or multiple instances of the same infraction that are discovered at the same time, are treated as a single infraction.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="1.3"></a></p><h4>1.3 RANDOMIZING A DECK</h4>
<p>
The remedy for some infractions in this document includes shuffling the randomized portion of the deck. This requires first determining whether any portion of the deck is non-random, such as cards that have been manipulated on the top or bottom of the library, and separating those. Check with both players to verify this, and check the graveyard, exile, and battlefield for deck manipulation cards, such as Brainstorm and cards with the scry mechanic. Once the deck has been shuffled, any manipulated cards are returned to their correct locations.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Shuffles perfomed by a judge as part of a remedy are not considered shuffles for game purposes.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="1.4"></a></p><h4>1.4 BACKING UP</h4>
<p>
Some infractions in this document permit the judge to consider the possibility of a backup. Due to the amount of information that may become available to players and might affect their play, backups are regarded as a solution of last resort, only applied in situations where leaving the game in the current state is a substantially worse solution. A good backup will result in a situation where the gained information makes no difference and the line of play remains the same (excepting the error, which has been fixed). This means limiting backups to situations with minimal decision trees.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Only the Head Judge may authorize a backup. At large tournaments, they may choose to delegate this responsibility to Team Leaders.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
To perform a backup, each individual action since the point of the error is reversed, starting with the most recent ones and working backwards. Every action must be reversed; no parts of the sequence should be omitted or reordered. If the identity of a card involved in reversing an action is unknown to one of the players (usually because it was drawn), a random card is chosen from the possible candidates. Shuffles are reversed by a single shuffle of the random portion of the library after the rest of the backup is complete. A card that became legally known to a player after the error was committed is not considered random and is returned to the appropriate location after the shuffle has been completed.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Backups involving random/unknown elements should be approached with extreme caution, especially if they cause or threaten to cause a situation in which a player will end up with different cards than they would once they have correctly drawn those cards. For example, returning cards to the library when a player has the ability to shuffle their library is not something that should be done except in extreme situations.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Some remedies state a simple backup may be performed. A simple backup is backing up the last action completed (or one currently in progress) and is sometimes used to make another portion of the prescribed remedy smoother. A simple backup should not involve any random elements.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="2"></a></p><h4>2 GAME PLAY ERRORS</h4>
<p>
Game Play Errors are caused by incorrect or inaccurate play of the game such that it results in violations of the Magic Comprehensive Rules. Many offenses fit into this category and it would be impossible to list them all. The guide below is designed to give judges a framework for assessing how to handle a Game Play Error.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Most Game Play Error infractions are assumed to have been committed unintentionally. If the judge believes that the error was intentional, he or she should first consider whether an Unsporting Conduct - Cheating infraction has occurred.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
With the exception of Failure to Maintain Game State, which is never upgraded, the third or subsequent penalty for a Game Play Error offense in the same category is upgraded to a Game Loss. For multi-day events, the penalty count for these infractions resets between days.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="2.1"></a></p><h4>2.1 Game Play Error - Missed Trigger</h4>
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Penalty</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A triggered ability triggers, but the player controlling the ability doesn't demonstrate awareness of the trigger's existence the first time that it would affect the game in a visible fashion.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The point by which the player needs to demonstrate this awareness depends on the impact that the trigger would have on the game:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that requires its controller to choose targets (other than 'target opponent'), modes, or other choices made when the ability is put onto the stack: The controller must announce those choices before they next pass priority.
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that causes a change in the visible game state (including life totals) or requires a choice upon resolution: The controller must take the appropriate physical action or acknowledge the specific trigger before taking any game actions (such as casting a sorcery spell or explicitly taking an action in the next step or phase) that can be taken only after the triggered ability should have resolved. Note that passing priority, casting an instant spell or activating an ability doesn't mean a triggered ability has been forgotten, as it could still be on the stack.
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that changes the rules of the game: The controller must acknowledge the trigger or prevent an opponent from taking any resulting illegal action.
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that affects the game state in non-visible ways: The controller must make the change known by the first time the change has an effect on the visible game state.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Once any of the above obligations has been fulfilled, further problems are treated as a Game Play Error - Game Rule Violation.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Triggered abilities that do nothing except create delayed triggered abilities automatically resolve without requiring acknowledgment. Awareness of the resulting delayed trigger must be demonstrated at the appropriate point. Triggered abilities that do nothing except create one or more copies of a spell or ability (such as storm or cipher) automatically resolve, but awareness of the resulting objects must be demonstrated using the same requirements as described above (even though the objects may not be triggered abilities).
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If a triggered ability would have no impact on the game, it's not an infraction to fail to demonstrate awareness of it. For example, if the effect of a triggered ability instructs its controller to sacrifice a creature, a player who controls no creatures isn't required to demonstrate awareness of the ability. Similarly, a player demonstrating awareness of an optional trigger with no visible effect is assumed to have made the affirmative choice unless the opponent responds.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Judges do not intervene in a missed trigger situation unless they intend to issue a Warning or have reason to suspect that the controller is intentionally missing his or her triggered abilities.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
A player controlling another player is responsible for that player's triggers in addition to his or her own.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. Knight of Infamy (a 2/1 creature with exalted) attacks alone. Its controller says Take two.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player forgets to remove the final time counter from a suspended spell and then draws a card during his draw step.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player casts Manic Vandal, then forgets its triggered ability by not choosing a target for it. He realizes this only after casting another spell.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player forgets to exile the Angel token created by Geist of Saint Traft at end of combat.<br>
</p><p>
She realizes the error when declaring blockers during the next turn.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Triggered abilities are common and invisible, so players should not be harshly penalized when forgetting about one. Players are expected to remember their own triggered abilities; intentionally ignoring one may be Unsporting Conduct - Cheating (unless the ability would have no impact on the game as described above). Even if an opponent is involved in the announcement or resolution of the ability, the controller is still responsible for ensuring the opponents make the appropriate choices and take the appropriate actions. Opponents are not required to point out triggered abilities that they do not control, though they may do so if they wish.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered until otherwise indicated, and the impact on the game state may not be immediately apparent. The opponent's benefit is in not having to point out triggered abilities, although this does not mean that they can cause triggers to be missed. If an opponent requires information about the precise timing of a triggered ability or needs details about a game object that may be affected by a resolved triggered ability, that player may need to acknowledge that ability's existence before its controller does. A player who makes a play that may or may not be legal depending on whether an uncommunicated trigger has been remembered has not committed an infraction; their play either succeeds, confirming that the trigger has been missed, or is rewound.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Players may not cause triggered abilities controlled by an opponent to be missed by taking game actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the game. During an opponent's turn, if a trigger's controller demonstrates awareness of the trigger before they take an active role (such as taking 8
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
an action or explicitly passing priority), the trigger is remembered. The Out-of-Order Sequencing rules (MTR section 4.3) may also be applicable, especially as they relate to batches of actions or resolving items on the stack in an improper order.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
If the triggered ability specifies a default action associated with a choice made by the controller (usually "If you don't ..." or "... unless"), give the opponent the choice to resolve it choosing the default option. If the triggered ability is a delayed triggered ability that changes the zone of one or more objects defined when the ability was created, resolve it. For these two types of abilities, the opponent chooses whether to resolve the ability the next time a player would get priority or when a player would get priority at the start of the next phase. These abilities do not expire and should be remedied no matter how much time has passed since they should have triggered.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the ability was missed prior to the current phase in the previous turn, instruct the players to continue playing. If the triggered ability created an effect whose duration has already expired, instruct the players to continue playing.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the triggered ability isn't covered by the previous two paragraphs, the opponent chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the stack. If it is, it's inserted at the appropriate place on the stack if possible or on the bottom of the stack. No player may make choices involving objects that would not have been legal choices when the ability should have triggered. For example, if the ability instructs a player to sacrifice a creature, that player can't sacrifice a creature that wasn't on the battlefield when the ability should have triggered.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: If the triggered ability is usually considered detrimental for the controlling player the penalty is a Warning. The current game state is not a factor in determining this, though symmetrical abilities (such as Howling Mine) may be considered usually detrimental or not depending on who is being affected
